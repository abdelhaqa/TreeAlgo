## Problems related with primitive data structures, arrays and strings

## Problems: 
1. [Get Max Product of all integers in an array except one. Division is NOT allowed. Array can have -ve numbers as well.](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/array-strings/maxProductExceptOne.go)
   <br/>arr {2, 4, 9, 3} ; Max Product = 4 * 9 * 3 = 108
   <br/> arr {-1, -10, 3}; Max Product = (-1) * (-10) = 10 

2. [Given an array of integers; find the longest contiguous increasing subarray. You should return the start index and end index of the subarray](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/array-strings/longestContiguousIncreasingSubarray.go)
   <br/>arr {2, 11, 3, 5, 13, 7, 19, 17, 233} ; Result = 2,4
   <br/> Longest contiguous increasing subarray would be {3,5,13}  starts at index 2 and ends at index 4

2. [Rotate an array in-place by k places](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/array-strings/rotateArray.go)
   <br/>arr {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} , k=3;
   <br /> Result = {5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4}
