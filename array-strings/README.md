## Problems related with primitive data structures, arrays and strings

## Problems: 
1. [Get Max Product of all integers in an array except one. Division is NOT allowed. Array can have -ve numbers as well.](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/recursion/maxProductExceptOne.go)
   <br/>arr {2,4,9,3}
   <br /> Max Product = 4*9*3 = 108

## Testing
 [array_test.go](arrays_test.go) Tests above problems
