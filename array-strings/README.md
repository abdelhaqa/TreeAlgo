## Problems related with primitive data structures, arrays and strings

## Problems: 
1. [Get Max Product of all integers in an array except one. Division is NOT allowed. Array can have -ve numbers as well.](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/recursion/maxProductExceptOne.go)
   <br/>arr {2, 4, 9, 3} ; Max Product = 4 * 9 * 3 = 108
   <br/> arr {-1, -10, 3}; Max Product = (-1) * (-10) = 10 

## Testing
 [array_test.go](arrays_test.go) Tests above problems
