## Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree Problems

## BST Problems
Binary Search Tree is a binary tree in which nodes have to respect the *BST property* - the key stored at a node is greater than or equal to the keys stored at the nodes of its left subtree and less than or equal to the keys stored in the nodes of its right subtree.

1. [Find minimum/maximum value](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/tree/bst.go)
 <br /> Given a Binary search tree; find the minimum value. 

2. [Find 2nd largest value](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/tree/secondLargestValue.go)

3. [Find inorder successor of a node](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/tree/inorderSuccessor.go)

4. [Find kth largest element](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/tree/findKthLargestElement.go)

5. [Check if given binary tree is balanced](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/tree/isBst.go)

6. [Calculate sum of first (or last) K elements in inorder traversal](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/tree/sumFirstKElements.go)

7. [Find floor and ceil of a given value](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/tree/floorAndCeil.go)


## Binary Tree Problems

1. [Find diameter](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/tree/findDiameterOfTree.go)
<br /> Diameter (aka width) of a tree is longest path or route between any two nodes in a tree. The path may or may not pass through the root. 

2. [Check if given tree is balanced](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/tree/isBalanced.go)
<br /> Balanced Binary tree is a tree whose height is of order of log(number of elements in the tree).
<br /> OR
<br /> A binary tree in which the depth/height of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
3. [Perform level order traversal iteratevely](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/tree/levelOrderTraversal.go)
4. [Calculate maximum sum from root to any of the leaf node](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/tree/maxSumRootToLeaf.go)
5. [Get all cousions of a given node](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/tree/printCousinsOfNode.go)
6. [Print bottom view of tree](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/tree/bottomView.go)
7. [Print left view of tree](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/tree/leftView.go)
8. [Perform diagonal traversal](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/tree/diagonalTraversal.go)

## Testing
 [tree_test.go](tree_test.go) can be used to test any implementation.
