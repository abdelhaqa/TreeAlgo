## Recursion and Backtracking related Problems

## Recursion Problems

## Exhaustive Recursion
Using exhaustive search we consider all subsets irrespective of whether they satisfy given constraints or not. 
- [Subset sum]

## Backtracking Problems
- [Print all permutations of a String with all unique characters](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/recursion/permutation.go)
- [Find all binary strings that can be formed by replacing wildcard '?' with 0 and 1](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/tree/allCombinationsOfBinaryStrings.go)
- [Subset Sum problem](https://github.com/raiskumar/algo-ds/blob/master/recursion/subsetSum.go)

## Testing
 [recursion_test.go](recursion_test.go) can be used to test any implementation.
